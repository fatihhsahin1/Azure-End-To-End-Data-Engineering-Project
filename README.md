# Olympic Data Analytics | Azure End-To-End Data Engineering Project
This repository is a testament to a comprehensive exploration of Azure's data engineering tools, as applied to the Tokyo Olympic dataset. From the initial phase of data ingestion to final visualization, the project accentuates the capabilities of Azure's data solutions.


# Repository Structure:
- `Data`: Folder containing the original and processed datasets vital for this analysis.
- `architecture_diagram.jpg`: Visual depiction of the entire data processing architecture.
- `Basic_Analysis.sql`: Essential SQL scripts for the primary data analyses.
- `Data-ingestion_pipeline.png`: A visual explanation of the data ingestion workflow.
- `Report.png`: A preview of the constructed Power BI report dashboard.
- `Tokyo Olympic Transformation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that elaborates on the data transformation executed via Azure Databricks.
- `TokyoOlympic_Report.pbix`: A Power BI Desktop document which elegantly presents the insights and visualizations derived from the dataset.

This project is to showcase the potential of Azure's Data Engineering tools. The arsenal used comprises:

__Azure Data Factory__: For automating the data flow and orchestrating the ETL process.

__Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2__: Used as a scalable and secure data lake that allowed high-speed and massively parallel analytics.

__Azure Databricks__: Where the heart of data transformation and cleaning resided.

__Azure Synapse Analytics__: A limitless analytics service that brought the capability for large scale data warehousing and big data analytics.

__Power BI__: The ultimate tool used for creating intuitive visualizations and interactive reports, facilitating the storytelling of our data analysis.

While __Azure Synapse Analytics__ alone could cater to most of the requirements, the conscious choice of utilizing a range of tools was made to deepen the practical understanding and to exhibit versatility in handling Azure's suite of data solutions.

# Insights & Conclusions:
Diving deep into the Tokyo Olympics dataset, this project illuminates diverse metrics, such as country performances, gender distribution across events, and more. The final interactive Power BI report (TokyoOlympic_Report.pbix) encapsulates these analyses.

This project provided key Olympic insights and showcased my Azure data engineering skills
